# Lesson
- another solution of #3 with cmdwatcher
you should try online-sandbox if you encounter an problem on your envinment
- what is `Key-Scheduling Algorithm`
- understand the algorithm of `RC4`
- find an algorithm in a script

# #1
```bash
$ file 49b367ac261a722a7c2bbbc328c32545
$ trid 49b367ac261a722a7c2bbbc328c32545
$ sha256sum 49b367ac261a722a7c2bbbc328c32545
```

# #2
```bash
$ oledump.py 49b367ac261a722a7c2bbbc328c32545
```

# #3
```bash
$ olevba 49b367ac261a722a7c2bbbc328c32545
$ olevba 49b367ac261a722a7c2bbbc328c32545 --deobf
```

# #4
`olevba`

# #5
jscript    
I don't like this format of answer.

# #6
I tried my environment with `CMDWatcher`, but the macro did not work well.  
Then I give up this and following questions except #16 and #17.
I should have try online-sandbox.  

With `HybridAnalysis`, I can see the commands.

# #7, #8, #9, #10. #11
`HybridAnalysis`

# 12
`HybridAnalysis`
Key-Scheduling Algorithm

# 13
`HybridAnalysis`
flag: command-line argument

A format of the answer is tough.

# 14
`HybridAnalysis`
flag: key

A format of the answer is tough.

# 15
`HybridAnalysis`
read scripts and find the algorithm.
flag: RC4

# 16
I could answer this with my knowledge.
flag: Eval

# 17
I could answer this with my knowledge.
flag: cscript.exe

# 18
decode base64 and RC4 with CyberChef.
flag: UspD
