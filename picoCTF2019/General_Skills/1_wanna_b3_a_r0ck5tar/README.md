# Lessons
- `Rockstar Programming Language`
- how to battle with unfamiliar languages 
    - use `transcompiler`
    - use diff for a bug generated by transcompile
    - use "guess"


# Memo  
1. run the rockstar code, but it didn't work  
https://web.archive.org/web/20190522030819/https://codewithrockstar.com/code  

2. understand the code  
    I want to skip a time for learning the usage of `Rockstar Programming Language.`  
    Then I use a transcompiler that translates it into python.

    - preparation
        ```zsh
        $ mkdir ./virtual_py3.10_rockstar
        $ virtualenv -p python3.10 virtual_py3.10_rockstar
        $ source ./virtual_py3.10_rockstar/bin/activate
        ## After this ctf,
        ## type "deactivate" and
        ## delete "virtual_py3.10_rockstar" folder
        ```
    - transcompile
        ```zsh
        $ rockstar-py -i lyrics.txt -o lyrics.py
        ```
    - read  
        lyrics.py is not good as python code.  
        It may be broken on the way to be transcompiled.  
        I could fix it based on my "guess", but I take another solution for accuracy and saving my time.
3. create runnable rockstar code  
    I guess that there are some unnecessary code in lyrics.txt.  
    To compare lyrics.txt with lyrics.py, I identify and remove the code.
    ![compare.png](compare.png)  
    the result of removing
    ![result.png](result.png)

4. run it on the online site provided by this ctf

    ```
    Rocknroll is right              
    Silence is wrong

    79
    78
    74
    79
    86
    73
    ```
    convert it
    ```py
    numbers = [66, 79, 78, 74, 79, 86, 73]

    result = ''.join(chr(num) for num in numbers)
    flag = "picoCTF{" + result + "}"
    print(flag)
    # picoCTF{BONJOVI}
    ```
