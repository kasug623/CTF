# Lesson  
- `java` training  
  - operator `^`  returns a value as int  
  When you XOR a byte with an integer literal like 0x55 (which is treated as an integer), you'll get a result of type int.  

# Memo  
just read the source code and write the solver.  
```zsh
$ javac Solver.java
$ java Solver 
flag is: picoCTF{n0t_mUcH_h4rD3r_tH4n_x0r_948b888}
```
