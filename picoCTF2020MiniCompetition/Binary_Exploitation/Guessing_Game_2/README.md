- RELRO  
    https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/relro  
    RELRO is a protection to stop any GOT overwrites from taking place, and it does so very effectively. There are two types of RELRO, which are both easy to understand.  
    - Partial RELRO  
    Partial RELRO simply moves the GOT above the program's variables, meaning you can't overflow into the GOT. This, of course, does not prevent format string overwrites.  
    - Full RELRO  
    Full RELRO makes the GOT completely read-only, so even format string exploits cannot overwrite it. This is not the default in binaries due to the fact that it can make it take much longer to load as it need to resolve all the function addresses at once.
