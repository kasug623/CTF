- `__libc_start_main`
  ```c
  __libc_start_main(FUN_0814c22c,param_2,&stack0x00000004,FUN_0814c6d0,FUN_0814c730,param_1,
                    auStack_4);
  ```
  `__libc_start_main` is a function provided by the GNU C Library (glibc) in C programming.  
  It serves as the entry point for C programs, initiating the program's execution.  

  Typically, a C program begins with the main function:  

  ```C
  int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
  ```
  However, main is indirectly called by `__libc_start_main`, which initializes the C runtime environment and ensures proper execution of the program.  
  This function is responsible for program initialization and calling the main function. It guarantees that the C runtime environment is properly initialized for the program's execution.

  The syntax of __libc_start_main function is:
  ```c
  int __libc_start_main(int (*main) (int, char **, char **),
                        int argc, char *__unbounded *__unbounded ubp_av,
                        void (*init) (void), void (*fini) (void),
                        void (*rtld_fini) (void), void *__unbounded stack_end);
  ```
  The parameters of this function are interpreted as follows:

  - main: Pointer to the main function.  
  - argc: Number of command-line arguments passed to main.  
  - ubp_av: Pointer array to command-line arguments.  
  - init: Pointer to the program's initialization function.  
  - fini: Pointer to the program's finalization function.  
  - rtld_fini: Pointer to the dynamic linker's finalization function.  
  - stack_end: Pointer to the end of the stack.  
  These parameters are used for various initialization, execution, and finalization tasks of the program. __libc_start_main is typically set as the entry point for the executable file, but it can also be explicitly called by users if needed.
