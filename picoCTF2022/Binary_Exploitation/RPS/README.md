# Lesson
- `strstr()` of `c`  
    In the C programming language, strstr() is a standard library function defined in the <string.h> header. It is used to find the first occurrence of a substring within another string.
    ```c
    char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle);
    ```
    Here, haystack is the string in which you want to search for the occurrence of needle. The function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of needle in haystack. If needle is not found, the function returns a null pointer (NULL).

    example:
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>

    int main() {
        const char *haystack = "Hello, World!";
        const char *needle = "World";

        char *result = strstr(haystack, needle);

        if (result != NULL) {
            printf("Substring found at index: %ld\n", result - haystack);
        } else {
            printf("Substring not found\n");
        }

        return 0;
    }
    ```
    In this example, the strstr() function is used to find the first occurrence of the substring "World" in the string "Hello, World!". If the substring is found, it prints the index where the substring starts; otherwise, it prints that the substring is not found.

    Keep in mind that strstr() performs a case-sensitive search. If you need a case-insensitive search, you might consider using functions like strcasestr() (which is not standard and might not be available on all systems) or manually converting the strings to lowercase or uppercase before the search.

1. read the source  
    A point of getting the flag is this statement.
```c
if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
```
2. exploit
