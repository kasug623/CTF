    - compare with a valid format file
- PNG format  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG    

# Memo
1. guess the file format with Binary Editor  
It seems PNG.
2. fix the bynary with Binary Editor  
It is good to compare the broken one with a valid PNG file.  

3. check the result with `file` command  
If you can see a image file and cannot see a flag,  
you should try the next step.

4. check `steganography`  
    - check the value with `zsteg`  
    - check the rendered image with `AoZora`
